Short unedited ramblings about my happenings. Stuff related to both my life and
the projects I'm working on. I would call this a blog if the term hadn't been
hijacked to mean high-effort essays.

Every entry here has a dedicated page that are then aggregated onto this page.
Don't rely on this page staying the same! If you need to reference something
later, get a permalink!
