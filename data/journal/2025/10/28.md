I've gotten back into working on my Minecraft b1.7.3 server this past week, and
just today hit a massive milestone! I have Vanilla accurate terrain generation!
Currently it doesn't go beyond the initial stage of generation, biome features
like grass and such don't generate and the entire thing is made of stone, but
the shape is there. With this milestone I decided to finally make the project
[open source](https://github.com/cody-quinn/Minestalgia). All the code is there
and it should be pretty easy to run (especially if on Nix), just make sure you
do so in ReleaseSafe because ReleaseFast is currently broken for whatever
reason.

I'd also like to promote [Pixel Brush](https://pixelbrush.dev/)'s b1.7.3 server
software [Betrock](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockServer). His
project and goals are very similar to mine, and his [beta technical
wiki](https://pixelbrush.dev/beta-wiki/) has been very helpful in the
development of my server software.
