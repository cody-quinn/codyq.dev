Backwriting this entry on the (technically) 17th :3

I worked a lot on my dotfiles today. I know, typical NixOS user. As an aside I
told some people recently I'd be trying out FreeBSD and I think I've changed my
mind, at least for a while. Anyways finally my dotfiles are up to date and in
sync for the config on both my PC and my laptop. There's still some more
refactoring I'd like to do but oh well, it can wait.

Switched from IntelliJ as my primary editor to Zed again. It's improved a lot
since I switched away from it. I'm really liking it. Decided to switch back
because I saw GPUI got 0.2.0, which is nice. Would be really cool if someone
wrote Zig bindings to GPUI, it seems like a decent library for UI.
