Another website update today! I added an RSS feed to this journaling section. If
you for whatever reason still use RSS and want to keep up with this, that's a
way to do it. Other than that though I haven't done much programming sadly. I
haven't been touched the main project I've been working on in about a week. I
have some other things that take precedence but I hope to get back to it
sometime in the coming week.
