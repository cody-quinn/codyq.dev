Welcome! I'm Cody, a 20-year-old Computer Science nerd, and this is my personal homepage. Programming has long been an
interest of mine, beginning at 11 years old writing [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org) plugins in Java. But my interest didn't
stop at Bukkit plugins; it expanded to a general interest in Computer Science and making all sorts of things like
websites, simulations, bots, and compilers. Recently I've been going back to my roots of making Minecraft servers, but
with [Minestom](https://minestom.net) instead of Bukkit.

In addition to my interest in Computer Science, I'm interested in Linux and FOSS. I made the switch from Windows to
Linux in early 2020, deciding to install Arch. Despite the reputation Arch has, I found it easy
to install and setup with BSPWM. I've since used a number of distros and window managers before settling on what I use
today, [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org). I enjoy NixOS for its declarative nature and
stability, allowing me to easily host my system configs [on GitHub](https://github.com/cody-quinn/dotfiles).

Outside the tech world I enjoy Jet-skis, cars, and photography. I own a Yamaha WaveBlaster 1 with a Kawasaki 1100cc
engine swap that I got used in 2024. While I don't yet own a very nice car, my dream car is a Mazdaspeed NB Miata in
Velocity Red.
